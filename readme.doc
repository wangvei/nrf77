Please read this document completely before attempting to use the
NUMERICAL RECIPES EXAMPLE DISKETTE.  Your use of any programs on this
diskette constitutes acceptance of the terms of the DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY,
which is given in full at the end of this document.

WHAT IS THIS DISKETTE?
     This diskette contains machine-readable FORTRAN source programs that
exercise and demonstrate the FORTRAN subroutines from the book "Numerical
Recipes: The Art of Scientific Computing" published by Cambridge University
Press (1985).  Thus, to use this diskette effectively, you will also need
     -- the book "Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientific Computing"
     -- the NUMERICAL RECIPES FORTRAN DISKETTE containing the book's
          subroutines in machine-readable form.
It is helpful, but not required, for you to have also
     -- the "Numerical Recipes Example Book (FORTRAN)"
which is a printed listing of the Fortran programs on this diskette, along
with a short introductory explanation of each program.  Details on how to
order these and other items are given at the end of this document.

WHAT PROGRAMS ARE ON THIS DISKETTE?
     There are 189 FORTRAN programs on this diskette, with names
corresponding to the NUMERICAL RECIPES subroutines that they exercise, and
with file extensions .DEM; for example, the NUMERICAL RECIPES subroutine
JACOBI is exercised by the program JACOBI.DEM.  Also on this diskette are
10 data files, which are used by some of the demonstration programs.  These
all have extensions .DAT.  A complete list of the programs on this
diskette is in the file NAMES.DOC, which you can type or print out.
     Note, as mentioned above, that the NUMERICAL RECIPES subroutines to be
exercised are not on this diskette.  They are listed in "Numerical Recipes:
The Art of Scientific Computing" and distributed in machine-readable form
as the NUMERICAL RECIPES FORTRAN DISKETTE. 

WHAT VERSION OF FORTRAN IS USED?
     The programs on this diskette are in that subset of ANSI standard
FORTRAN-77 that is implemented by Microsoft Corporation in Microsoft
FORTRAN, version 3.20.  No incompatibilities with the full FORTRAN-77
standard have been introduced, so the program versions on this diskette
should also run on any full implementation of the FORTRAN-77 standard.  For
compilers that deviate from the standard, minor modifications in the
programs are required.

HOW DO YOU ACCESS THE PROGRAMS?
     This diskette has two "hidden" subdirectories.  The subdirectory
\DEMOS contains the 189 programs, all with names of the format *.DEM, while
the subdirectory \DATA contains the ten data files.  For example, if this
diskette is in drive A:, you can copy the program BCUCOF.DEM to your
working directory by the command
COPY A:\DEMOS\BCUCOF.DEM <enter>
where <enter> denotes the enter or return key.  If you want to copy all the
program files, e.g. to a hard disk, you can do this by the two commands
COPY A:\DEMOS\*.*
COPY A:\DATA\*.*
This will take some time, since the number of files is large.  Also note
that most hard disks have a minimum file block size of 4096 bytes.  Since
most of the files are much shorter than that, the programs on this diskette
will occupy substantially more space on a hard disk.  We recommend that you
create a backup copy of this diskette using the DISKCOPY command, then copy
individual programs to your working directory only as you need them.

HOW DO YOU USE THE PROGRAMS?
     The purpose of the .DEM programs is pedagogical, to furnish you with a
demonstration example of the use of each NUMERICAL RECIPES subroutine. 
Often, you will only need to read the .DEM program file (in conjunction
with "Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientific Computing") to get a clear
idea of how to proceed with your own application.  Sometimes, however, it
is useful to carry the demonstration through compilation, linking,
execution, and even some experimental tinkering with the demonstration
program.  In that way you develop confidence in your understanding of the
underlying numerical procedure.  
     Here is an example of this procedure, for the NUMERICAL RECIPE
subroutine AMOEBA.  We assume that you are using the Microsoft FORTRAN
compiler (for another compiler consult your documentation).  DOS commands
that you enter are given in upper case; you do not enter the bracketed,
lower-case comments.  Your working directory is assumed to be disk drive B,
with DOS prompt B>
     [put this diskette in drive A]
B> COPY A:\DEMOS\AMOEBA.DEM     [copy the program to working directory]
     [put NUMERICAL RECIPES FORTRAN DISKETTE in drive A]
B> COPY A:\RECIPES\AMOEBA.FOR   [copy the subroutine to working directory]
B> COPY A:\RECIPES\BESSJ0.FOR   [also used by AMOEBA.DEM]
B> FOR1 AMOEBA.DEM,AMOEBA.DBJ;  [compile the program]
B> PAS2                         [second pass of compiler]
B> FOR1 AMOEBA.FOR;             [compile subroutine]
B> PAS2                         [second pass]
B> FOR1 BESSJ0.FOR;             [compile subroutine]
B> PAS2                         [second pass]
B> LINK AMOEBA.DBJ+AMOEBA+BESSJ0,;      [link all required programs]
B> AMOEBA                       [run the demonstration program]
     If the demonstration program required a data file, you would have
copied it to your working directory from A:\DATA as the very first step. 
You find out what subroutines and data files are needed by a .DEM program
by reading its program listing on this diskette, or by consulting the
"Numerical Recipes Example Book (FORTRAN)."
